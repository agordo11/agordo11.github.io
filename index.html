        <h2>Technical Thursday: xDeception</h2>
        <h5>March 24, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">In this week's Technical Thursday I write about pitcher deception described as "one of baseball final unquantified frontiers."</h5>
        <p>I’ve decided to start doing Technical Thursday’s in addition to technical Tuesday’s during the weeks where I have a lot of baseball on my mind (most weeks lol). Today I will introduce the project I dedicate most of my time, xDeception: Quantifying Pitcher Biomechanical Uniqueness.<br><br>What is Pitcher Deception? Deception is a very common term in the baseball world that essentially is coined when a pitcher delivery is uniquely suited to deceive a hitter. Hitters naturally predict how a pitch will move and where they expect it be based off what they’ve seen in the past. So, if a pitcher is able to be unique in the way he delivers the ball versus the average he is more deceptive than someone who delivers the ball to the catcher in a more average fashion.<br><br>What already exists? There has been a ton of work put in to quantifying a pitchers unique ability to make a pitch move. This is called the pitcher’s stuff. There are a wide variety of stuff metrics that consider different things, but they all only model for uniqueness for what happens after the ball is released. xDeception considers only what happens prior to ball release.<br><br>It started as an introductory project this past summer where I evenly weighted the top 3 parts I thought were most influential; extension, hidden ball ratio and deviation from average arm slot. <br><br>Extension is how far the pitcher’s hand is from the rubber when the ball is released. If a pitcher can achieve and high extension then the ball has to travel less distance making the ball appear to be thrown harder than it actually was. Hidden ball ratio is the ratio of frames that the pitcher is able to hide the ball from the hitter from when the hands separate from the glove until the pitcher’s front foot (plant foot) hits the ground. The theory behind arm slot deviation is a bit more complex. Arm slot is the angle at which base of the throwing arm is to the ground. The amount of time between front foot plant and ball release is the shortest of major time periods in the delivery so hitters have to use past experience the most during this period to predict where the pitch will come out. Arm slot deviation models for how much a pitcher is able to deviate from the average change of arm slot from foot plant to ball release. <br><br>Currently I’ve taken a more data driven approach that is clustering for outliers. This removes most of my personal bias because allowing for a machine learning model to learn the data unsupervised and find anomalies in the data that I give to the model. <br><br>In my current model extension has a very low effect on causing outlier, so I’ve removed it. The seemingly endless process I’ve been going through recently is giving the model certain features (a feature is when I take a list of location or velocities over a time period and extract it into a single value) that I believe to play the largest role and seeing how it effects the strength of the model. I’m very excited for the potential of this project as it has been described as “one of baseball’s final unquantified frontiers.”</p>

        <h2>Subtraction</h2>
        <h5>March 23, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">How can you get what you want by subtracting? </h5>
        <p>There’s so much talk about what the best supplements are and what supplements can be added to our diets to improve our health, ability to recover or ability to put on muscle and lose fat. The free market has given us hundreds and hundreds of potential answers, but a better question is, what can be removed from our diets or routines to get what we want. This applies to all part of life.<br><br>As motivated humans we naturally are looking for things that we can add to our lives to make things better but often adding things just leads to the desire to add more things later. What is almost always overlooked is that you can achieve the same thing by removing something.<br><br>There are endless examples, like if your trying to allow your muscles to recover better. Instead of adding a protein supplement what if you spend less time on your phone so you can sleep more. If you’re trying to make more money, instead of working more, what if you spend less. It’s a very powerful question to ask yourself, how can I get what I want by subtracting?<br><br>I’ve taken this approach in practicing baseball. I go over it more in depth in my March 15 blog post, but the gist of it is when adding things to my daily routine, all the benefits that drill or stretch was giving me was hurting my decision fatigue more than the drill was helping me physically. So, maybe adding these supplements and our various other wants are just fuel for overthought.<br><br>I don’t think I’m alone with having thoughts along the lines of if I only had this then I could do this. These thoughts just lead us to think we can’t take action towards our passions because the first path we see to success is not within our means. I go to this a lot, but with good reason. The creativity involved in the adventure to excellence is one of the most fulfilling parts of it. <br><br>Looking back at my time playing JUCO baseball, the most beautiful aspect of it was how much we were able to achieve with how little resources that we had. During the height of the COVID lockdown, my teammates and I were desperately trying to find somewhere where we could practice. We couldn’t use our own field, we got kicked off of multiple high school fields and there were no private facilities that would let us use their buildings. So, we threw plyo balls (squishy balls filled with sand) into a mattress in our apartment and threw in the alley behind our apartment building. Funny enough, looking back, there was never any other period of time where I improved more than for the few months be creative making due with what we had.<br><br>There’s definitely something to be learned from all the wealthy people who aren’t happy. In one of my favorite movies, Fight Club, there’s a very famous quote, “The things you own end up owning you.” Likewise, the things you want end up owning you. If we allow the things we don’t have to dictate how we take action on our passions, they are owning us. So, instead of looking for something to get in order to get a desired outcome. How can you get what you want with what you already have or by removing or getting rid of something?</p>

        <h2>Technical Tuesday #2 - Imitation and it's application to player development</h2>
        <h5>March 22, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">Day 14, two weeks straight and episode two Technical Tuesday! </h5>
        <p>In my March 16 blog post, The Power of Understanding Desire, I talked a little about how we are all born natural imitators. It’s one of the defense mechanisms we have developed throughout our evolution. The instant a baby is born they look to their mother and begin to understand what should be valued by what the mother is giving her attention to.<br><br>I know your definitely asking yourself, today is the second edition of Technical Tuesday, how is Ari relating all of this to baseball development? Well here’s how.<br><br>One of my favorite books on the mental side of sports is The Inner Game of Tennis by Tim Galloway. In the book, he talks about how we have two selves. Self 1 is the conscious mind, while self 2 is subconscious mind. Self 1 is in control when we try to make our bodies complete deliberate movements, while flow-state is when our self 2 takes over. <br><br>Pitchers mechanical movements are extremely important and it often leads to building too large of a relationship with self 1. When in self 1, there is no flow, so the mind is actively trying to activate and deactivate muscles, and 99.9% of the time will get it wrong. <br><br>This is where self 2 comes in and we take advantage of that natural defense mechanism. If the pitcher knows how they want a movement to look like very clearly, they allow the imitation to happen. <br><br>Look at Tiger Woods and his kid. His kid almost perfectly imitates the movements of his father’s golf swing and is playing golf at a level unparalleled with other kids his age. I think this also plays a large role in the team setting.<br><br>Something I’ve observed from the various places I’ve played at is when all the players first arrive on campus, the standard deviation of their peak velocity tends to be much larger than it is at the end of the year. I have no data to back it up but it’s just something I’ve noticed and I think it all has to do with imitation. <br><br>I haven’t yet decided if this is because the players will imitate the average or imitate the best players on the team. I think it depends on what level they are at and what the priorities are. But it’s definitely a very interesting observation that I wonder its’ effect at a larger scale.<br><br>I will write again about this again in the future. Very curious to how this can be actively manipulated by coaches to improve skill level across the board.</p>

        <h2>Adundantly Weird</h2>
        <h5>March 21, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">Weirdness should be in style, being the weird person you know you are deep down.</h5>
        <p>My personality has always teetered more to the weird side of the spectrum. I was never heavily bullied, but being weird and acting different makes you an easy target for getting picked on. You can’t really pick on people who never do weird things. <br><br>I always thought of this part of my personality as a negative and as a result in recent years I’ve tamed down my weirdness except around my closest friends. You guys know who you are haha. More recently, I’ve realized, who the fuck wants to hang out with normal people. Normal people are just boring. They go to work/school, get drunk, sit on their phones, watch Netflix; they just follow the pack. <br><br>Weirdness breads uniqueness, and that is where the real fun experiences and relationships are rooted. Living in the abundance of weirdness attracts unique people which will only create the unique and extremely memorable experiences we all crave deep down. So, yeah, basically, I’m bringing the mustache back for a bit. I want everybody I randomly come across to think I’m fucking weird.</p>

        <h2>Sunday Shorties #2 - Benny Beans</h2>
        <h5>March 20, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">Funny story idea given to me from a friend from an irrational fear I had and unarguably still have.</h5>
        <p>Benny HATES beans. In fact, he claims, he has a fully rational fear of them. One night when his mom put a serving platter of beans on the table, benny lost it.<br><br>“No Mom! Beans are evil. They are little balls of death. I won’t sit at the same table as them because you never know they might jump off the table and take over our house like a pack of rabid ants.”<br><br>See! The fear is fully rational…<br><br>Is there even such thing as rabid ants?<br><br>Unlike most 13-year-old boys who hate beans because they are picky eaters. Benny truly knew the evil intentions of each bean every bean and would never put one in his body.<br><br>It’s almost as if Benny’s life purpose is to expose each and every bean’s true intentions. Once when he was 11, chipotle swapped his burrito with someone else’s that had BLACK BEANS in it. He would not stop talking about how he was going to sue that Chipotle for everything that they had.<br><br> This is why Benny became a lawyer. The 11-year-old said, “I’m going to law school, I can’t allow anyone else to ever have to go through that again. Need to file a class action lawsuit this second.”<br><br>Now how many 11-year-olds do you hear the words, “class action lawsuit” come out of their mouth. <br><br>As Benny aged, he began to realize the irrationality in his extremely rational fear, but he never lost that fight for the things he believed in. Benny went on to become one of the best lawyers in New York City, using that same fight to win out over his extremely rational fear.</p>

        <h2>Present Danger</h2>
        <h5>March 19, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">“The achievement doesn’t really change your life like you think it might, but really what you’re left with is the journey.” -Marc-André Leclerc</h5>
        <p>My favorite documentary I can remember seeing is “The Alpinist.” The doc follows Marc-André Leclerc, one of the greatest climbers to ever walk this earth. Marc-André mostly participated in a type of climbing called, free soloing, in which the climber uses no ropes or safety nets. In the doc the various climbers say that there is something about free soloing that pulls them very deeply in the present moment, as if nothing else matters. These climber’s calmness while doing such a life-threatening task for no apparent reason is completely memorizing. I like to say that activities like free soloing, that are very dangerous in the eyes of the observer but are completed with an unprecedented calmness, have a lot of present danger.<br><br>I’m defining present danger as forcing a lack of anything except for the present moment because of the high danger involved. Along the same lines, I think the way Will Smith describes sky diving is a lot due to its’ present danger. He talks about the fear of the days prior to skydiving the first time. That every cell in your body is doing everything they can to convince your mind not to jump, but when you jump there is an ultimate bliss. An ultimate gravitational pull into the present.<br><br>I wonder how we can all use this principle of present danger to absolutely fall in love with the process and become completely present in the act of chasing our goals. Maybe we can trick our mind into thinking we are more often in life or death scenarios, getting rid of the fear of failure and swapping it for an absolute necessity to win or fulfill our dreams.</p>

        <h2>Learning Skills</h2>
        <h5>March 18, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">"Everything is a scam." - Riva Tez</h5>
        <p>I used to tell myself I suck at reading, I suck at writing, I suck at this or that. When at the very moment that may have been true but the connotation of telling ourselves that we suck at something is very negative and removes all motivation. Instead we should increasingly embrace the adventure to excellence at the skills we want to learn that may not come naturally.<br><br>I wanted to start a blog for years but never did because I kept telling myself I sucked at writing and look now. I’m rolling. Being a math major I see this a lot. People always asking me for math help saying they suck at math but that is just because they’ve been telling that to themselves all their lives. All parts of the brain can be developed, it just takes time and effort. There is tons of scientific research on this. The one study I always go back to is on London Taxi drivers before the age of GPS. For background, London has one of the most complicated and confusing layouts of any city in the world and these taxi drivers were expected to memorize all the ins and outs of it. The study measured the size of these new taxi driver’s hippocampus, the part that is responsible for spatial recognition, before they started driving and after a period of six months. The size of all these taxi driver’s spatial recognition sector of their brain all increased in size by a significant percentage.<br><br>Moral of the story is the things we tell ourselves are often false. We can all learn any skill we want. The barriers to entry are all just scams. Do what you want to.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Identity</h2>
        <h5>March 17, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">Your Identity creates your reality.</h5>
        <p>I saw this quote yesterday; your identity creates your reality. <br><br>I’ve seen quotes similar before but I really liked how simple this phrased it. It’s so simple yet so many of us don’t even know who we are. By letting other people or the ego define our identity, we give up control over our reality. If we take time to design and become extremely clear on our identity then we all can create the reality that we dream of. <br><br>I think not having my identity defined in the past was pretty much the root of all the problems I’ve had. I would be anxious socially because I didn’t understand who I was and wanted to be and unsure of myself on the mound because I was letting my ego and the people evaluating me set my identity as a player. <br><br>Reality is fully transformable. After all, we are just sacks of cells that at the quantum level don’t even abide by the laws of physics. So, why do we even follow rules? Why do we allow our identities to be restricted by anything? Having a true understanding of our identity is the first step at controlling our reality.</p>

        <h2>The Power of Understanding Desire</h2>
        <h5>March 16, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">My initial thoughts from the first third of the book, Wanting by Luke Burgis.</h5>
        <p>I’m currently reading a book called Wanting by Luke Burgis about why we want what we want. Yesterday I overheard a conversation about the contradictory nature of the bachelor that went sometime like this… <br><br>Girls always talk about the things they hate that guys do and it most commonly seems to be guys who are players. Guys who sleep around with multiple girls at the same time or guys who cheat but such a large percentage of these same girls are captivated by The Bachelor where the one guy is doing the same things that the viewership complains about.<br><br>According to the book I’m reading, the author would say this happens because we are natural imitators and want what the people around us want. It’s pretty insane that what other people around us want can affect our desires so much that it causes us to break a large principle we would otherwise live by. <br><br>This wanting what the people around us want is often a very positive thing. Babies right out of whom can inherently understand what their mother wants and doesn’t want and it helps them survive. It’s very interesting how this principle of desire can be applied to get better results out of a team. I wonder how leaders can use the potential ability to make people desire to work harder simply because the people around them want the same.</p>

        <h2>Technical Tuesday: 80/20 your daily throwing routine, a potential cure for the y**s</h2>
        <h5>March 15, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">Technical Tuesday is where I write about a player development topic that is on my mind or a part of a project that I'm working on every tuesday.</h5>
        <p>The 80/20 principle suggests that you get at least 80% of the resulted outcome from at maximum 20% of inputs or effort. This has typically has stayed in the world of business and economics but it is very interesting to consider in terms of player development. The most obvious part that stands out to me is nutrition. I’ve known so many players that dominate their supplement routine but let the actual food they eat to be far below average. Eating 3 to 4, healthy and balanced meals per day is the 20% that gets at least 80% of results, while protein powder, creatine, mass-gainer, tart cherry juice and the list goes on forever is what gets those last few percentage points. I know I’m making a big claim here, but I think this principle is a key to getting rid of the dreaded y’s. <br><br>I won’t say it. <br><br>No, I won’t say it.  <br><br>Fine, the yips.<br><br>The largest commonality I’ve seen in myself and others that have been yipped is their pre and post throw routines. Typically, the guys who are in this situation are the ones who take the longest to complete their routines. I made this realization by accident. As I began to lose enjoyment this past fall as I struggled with command to the point where I lost all enjoyment, I decided to say fuck it and cut almost everything out of my routine except the few things that would get me at least 80% of the way. To be clear, I’m not suggesting to lower your ethic. I’m suggesting to direct the high work ethic to the things that are actually important.  <br><br>For me, the only things I kept was a dynamic warm up, bands and an extremely limited number of plyo throws. This included control over what my daily throwing regiment was. I began doing whatever throwing my throwing partner wanted to do. This naturally removed everything from my routine that allowed for overthinking. In other words, this removed all decision fatigue from my baseball life, allowing me to allocate my decision-making skills the most important parts of my routine without even having to think about it. <br><br>To the players out there struggling with playing time, command or anything of the sorts, I urge you to try the few things that get you most of the way, instead of getting lost in the 80% of things that only get you 20% of the way to your goals.</p>

        <h2>My Latest Habit</h2>
        <h5>March 14, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">What I've learned from so far from 50 hours in meditation in 2022</h5>
        <p>At the beginning of 2022, I committed to a minimum of 30 minutes of meditation every day. All my life I’ve been a perpetual overthinker and it has always been more negative for me than positive. This overthinking of pretty much everything combined with my analytical brain was the largest factor in maintaining all of my anxieties and lead to problems in many parts of my life. At the end of 2021 I started to lose fulfilment and enjoyment for the playing baseball, the thing I love to do the most, and my social anxiety had been the at the worst it had ever been. I knew I needed to address my constant absence from the present moment.<br><br>I wasn’t a complete beginner to meditation but in the past the motivation behind it was to improve my ability at a skill instead of reconnecting with each and every moment. This difference has proved to be very significant.  The hardest part about getting into meditation for beginners, besides any stigma they have towards it, is that there is very little immediate feedback. Back when I was doing it to as an attempt to improve my ability on the mound I had to force myself to do it and I could only consistently manage 10-minute sessions. Now, it’s become one of my favorite activities I do every day and my 30-minute session every morning flies by. The skill of being able to do absolutely nothing and enjoy it has completely changed all aspects of my life. I now love to go to practice every day again and my social anxiety has completely dissolved. <br><br>“How can you do anything if you can’t even do nothing.” If you’re not good at doing nothing, how can you expect to be at your best doing something? Being able to reconnect with the present and your inner being at any moment boosts creativity, focus and productivity to a level you would never expect possible while dissolving fears, anxieties and worries. This is why meditation has become such a important part of my daily routine. <br><br>If you want to get into it, I recommend not using any guided meditation. For me, guided mediation is just another curtain over the present moment. So, I recommend simply sitting completely still in a comfortable chair and setting a timer for 30-minutes and observe all the thoughts that come into your mind. A very important aspect to realize is that there is no such thing as failing in meditation. By sitting still and listening to your thoughts, it is automatically successful. I think you find that the 30-minutes goes by much faster than you’d think. </p>

        <h2>Sunday Shorties: 1</h2>

        <h5 style="color: #B22222">Sunday Shorties, every sunday I will post a fiction short story seeking to shed light on the why of my passions. Here's edition 1, would love to know what you think. It is my first time ever doing creative writing so don't be too harsh :). </h5>
        <p>“Gabe, you had a phenomenal season this year. You hit .402, with 8 home runs and 41 rbi’s leading the team in each while personifying what it looks like to be a selfless leader and having fun no matter if you had a good or bad game,” said Gabe’s coach at his little league teams end of the season celebration. <br><br>Gabe puts on a fake smile in the back yard of his coach’s house on a gorgeous August day surrounded by his teammates and all their parents after his team’s championship season as they enjoy barbeque from the teams sponsored restaurant. <br><br>Little did they all know that this would be Gabe’s last full season as he would quit it all together in the middle of the following one. Behind his fake smile, Gabe associated baseball with the constant torment from his father when he would strike out, make an error or virtually any other mistake. Gabe’s father was a former college baseball player that would’ve played professionally if not for his run ins with drugs and now his father was reliving his career and mistake’s he made through his son. <br><br>Gabe’s daily life looked something like this… <br></p>
        <ul>
          <li>8 am – 3 pm: School, in which the teachers would suck the life out of him by forcing him to complete mind-numbing activities.</li>
          <li>3 pm – 6 pm: Most days, Gabe and his friends would play video game’s which allowed him to be creative in the ways him and his friends competed to complete the game’s requirements.</li>
          <li>6 pm – Gabe’s bed time: When Gabe’s father got home from work and forced him to practice while constantly berating him on the different things he needed to work on.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Gabe’s father’s only intention was to help his son but he didn’t realize the emotional harm he was doing by reliving his past through his son. Little did he know Gabe would develop a hatred towards something that he used to be deeply in love with. <br><br>Imagine the future we are heading towards as the number of kids in Gabe’s situation increases. That sure isn’t one I’m going to let exist.</p>

        <h2>The movies behind wise eyes</h2>
        <h5>March 12, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">A bit of a longer and deeper post today.</h5>
        <p>My biggest fear is at the end of my life looking back with regret that I didn’t build what I dreamt of building or experience the things I dreamt of experiencing. Recently I had the opportunity to listen to someone speak about their time playing baseball at the same place I’m currently at and the look in his eyes left a permanent imprint in my brain. The amount of light he had in his eyes immediately reminded me of the look in my grandpa’s eyes after my grandmother died. I could never put my finger on why that look in his eyes was so powerful until I had the opportunity to listen to this man speak. Anatomically, the iris, the colored part of the eye, is a perforated muscular curtain. These perforations are like pixels that make up the movie screen as a portal into someone’s perspective and experience. If present enough to notice, the movie shown behind wise eyes can be an insanely valuable teacher. The powerful emotions combined with wisdom are what makes these movies viewable in ultra-high definition.<br><br>It was funny because he never mentioned a word about any actual games. Nothing about how well he played, nothing about what he had accomplished and nothing about how the team played or what they had accomplished. He talked about all the shenanigans he did with the people he cared about the most and the work him and his team struggled through to start building UNC Charlotte into what it has become today. At the time they didn’t even have a baseball field. They would go practice at a high school field and come back after and work tirelessly trying to make their own field. <br><br>Now thinking back to my time at JUCO when we were forced to make the most out of the little that we had, especially during COVID. When we got back in the late summer of 2020, our field was in shambles. It looked like it hadn’t been played on in decades. The six-foot-tall weeds spreading across the warning track was only the start, but as a team, we spent a week working our tails off pulling every single weed from the outfield and killing everything that was making the infield invisible. <br><br>It’s the things that are scratched and clawed for that really stick out in memories. I remember these periods of comfort in my life, like going on a relaxing vacation, long stretches of playing video games or going out and getting drunk to escape something and just exiting them feeling worse than I did before. On the flip side, the times of weeding the field at juco, river canoeing through the cold and rain on camping trips, staying up far too late working on my passions, strapping a portable mound to the top of my car and throwing plyos in my $200/month apartment are what have created true fulfilment in my life.<br><br>So, moral of the story, the more people that are building something, the better the world will be. My hope is for the future is for more people do the things and go the places that make them feel most alive.</p>

        <p>Being emotional can be a strength or a weakness depending on how it is harnessed, especially if it comes naturally.<br><br>A basketball coach I had when I was younger told me something that has stuck with me. After a game that we lost in which I fouled out in the third quarter and was a large part of my team losing, he told me “Don’t lose your ability to be emotional.”<br><br>Being emotional can be a detriment and remove from the present moment or it can pull even more deeply into the present.<br><br>Everyone has the power to choose which emotions they allow to drive them the most. Anger can drive a envious, ego driven spiral or it can be harnessed and boost curiosity creating even more momentum to your ultimate vision. In others words, use emotion to drive creativity, instead of despair.<br><br>Harness the energy of deep emotions, and let that energy build momentum in the adventure to excellence.</p>

        <h2>Deception</h2>
        <h5>March 10, 2022<br></h5>

        <p>My largest passion project currently is quantifying pitcher deception, which is said to be “One of baseball’s final unquantified frontiers.”<br><br>I came across this quote recently, “All warfare is based on deception”. Spending so much time thinking about how a pitcher deceives a hitter has led me to ask broader questions about it.<br><br>These questions are mostly based off social media and how the algorithms can be made to deceive and coerce it’s users.<br><br>So naturally I ask, when is it okay to deceive someone else?<br><br>I think depends on the perspective and intentions, hitters hate hitting against deceptive pitchers but love playing behind them. I think much of the same is true in the broader sense.<br><br>Deceiving the other side in order to promote your own growth and success is a part of holding the competitive advantage, but the line of deceiving people on your side is much more fine.<br><br>How are you being deceived and by whom and what?</p>

        <h2>A beautiful aspect of pitching</h2>
        <h5>March 9, 2022</h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">Pitching is my first love. Here's part of what makes it unique that I've recently come to realize. </h5>
        <p>Pitchers all have relatively the same number of throws in their arms. This is my math brain speaking theoretically.<br><br>Unlike pretty much all other sports, pitchers are extremely limited in the amount they can physically practice their skill each day. Really, they can make over 100 throws twice a week at most to keep injury risk manageable and these other days they can only throw between 30 and 60 throws.<br><br>That all adds up to 500–750 throws per week depending on role at the highest throwing volume part of the year. A basketball player can shoot over 10,000 shots per week and a wide receiver can catch that many passes a week.<br><br>Theoretically the best pitchers are the one who are most efficient with their throws and practice the smartest. This is where science and pitching first collide and the crazy part is it is just on the surface of where they do.<br><br>It’s beautiful. Who can be most efficient?</p>
