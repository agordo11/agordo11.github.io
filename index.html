        <h2>Understanding Identity</h2>
        <h5>March 17, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">Your Identity creates your reality.</h5>
        <p>I saw this quote yesterday; your identity creates your reality. <br><br>I’ve seen quotes similar before but I really liked how simple this phrased it. It’s so simple yet so many of us don’t even know who we are. By letting other people or the ego define our identity, we give up control over our reality. If we take time to design and become extremely clear on our identity then we all can create the reality that we dream of. <br><br>I think not having my identity defined in the past was pretty much the root of all the problems I’ve had. I would be anxious socially because I didn’t understand who I was and wanted to be and unsure of myself on the mound because I was letting my ego and the people evaluating me set my identity as a player. <br><br>Reality is fully transformable. After all, we are just sacks of cells that at the quantum level don’t even abide by the laws of physics. So, why do we even follow rules? Why do we allow our identities to be restricted by anything? Having a true understanding of our identity is the first step at controlling our reality.</p>

        <h2>The Power of Understanding Desire</h2>
        <h5>March 16, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">My initial thoughts from the first third of the book, Wanting by Luke Burgis.</h5>
        <p>I’m currently reading a book called Wanting by Luke Burgis about why we want what we want. Yesterday I overheard a conversation about the contradictory nature of the bachelor that went sometime like this… <br><br>Girls always talk about the things they hate that guys do and it most commonly seems to be guys who are players. Guys who sleep around with multiple girls at the same time or guys who cheat but such a large percentage of these same girls are captivated by The Bachelor where the one guy is doing the same things that the viewership complains about.<br><br>According to the book I’m reading, the author would say this happens because we are natural imitators and want what the people around us want. It’s pretty insane that what other people around us want can affect our desires so much that it causes us to break a large principle we would otherwise live by. <br><br>This wanting what the people around us want is often a very positive thing. Babies right out of whom can inherently understand what their mother wants and doesn’t want and it helps them survive. It’s very interesting how this principle of desire can be applied to get better results out of a team. I wonder how leaders can use the potential ability to make people desire to work harder simply because the people around them want the same.</p>

        <h2>Technical Tuesday: 80/20 your daily throwing routine, a potential cure for the y**s</h2>
        <h5>March 15, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">Technical Tuesday is where I write about a player development topic that is on my mind or a part of a project that I'm working on every tuesday.</h5>
        <p>The 80/20 principle suggests that you get at least 80% of the resulted outcome from at maximum 20% of inputs or effort. This has typically has stayed in the world of business and economics but it is very interesting to consider in terms of player development. The most obvious part that stands out to me is nutrition. I’ve known so many players that dominate their supplement routine but let the actual food they eat to be far below average. Eating 3 to 4, healthy and balanced meals per day is the 20% that gets at least 80% of results, while protein powder, creatine, mass-gainer, tart cherry juice and the list goes on forever is what gets those last few percentage points. I know I’m making a big claim here, but I think this principle is a key to getting rid of the dreaded y’s. <br><br>I won’t say it. <br><br>No, I won’t say it.  <br><br>Fine, the yips.<br><br>The largest commonality I’ve seen in myself and others that have been yipped is their pre and post throw routines. Typically, the guys who are in this situation are the ones who take the longest to complete their routines. I made this realization by accident. As I began to lose enjoyment this past fall as I struggled with command to the point where I lost all enjoyment, I decided to say fuck it and cut almost everything out of my routine except the few things that would get me at least 80% of the way. To be clear, I’m not suggesting to lower your ethic. I’m suggesting to direct the high work ethic to the things that are actually important.  <br><br>For me, the only things I kept was a dynamic warm up, bands and an extremely limited number of plyo throws. This included control over what my daily throwing regiment was. I began doing whatever throwing my throwing partner wanted to do. This naturally removed everything from my routine that allowed for overthinking. In other words, this removed all decision fatigue from my baseball life, allowing me to allocate my decision-making skills the most important parts of my routine without even having to think about it. <br><br>To the players out there struggling with playing time, command or anything of the sorts, I urge you to try the few things that get you most of the way, instead of getting lost in the 80% of things that only get you 20% of the way to your goals.</p>

        <h2>My Latest Habit</h2>
        <h5>March 14, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">What I've learned from so far from 50 hours in meditation in 2022</h5>
        <p>At the beginning of 2022, I committed to a minimum of 30 minutes of meditation every day. All my life I’ve been a perpetual overthinker and it has always been more negative for me than positive. This overthinking of pretty much everything combined with my analytical brain was the largest factor in maintaining all of my anxieties and lead to problems in many parts of my life. At the end of 2021 I started to lose fulfilment and enjoyment for the playing baseball, the thing I love to do the most, and my social anxiety had been the at the worst it had ever been. I knew I needed to address my constant absence from the present moment.<br><br>I wasn’t a complete beginner to meditation but in the past the motivation behind it was to improve my ability at a skill instead of reconnecting with each and every moment. This difference has proved to be very significant.  The hardest part about getting into meditation for beginners, besides any stigma they have towards it, is that there is very little immediate feedback. Back when I was doing it to as an attempt to improve my ability on the mound I had to force myself to do it and I could only consistently manage 10-minute sessions. Now, it’s become one of my favorite activities I do every day and my 30-minute session every morning flies by. The skill of being able to do absolutely nothing and enjoy it has completely changed all aspects of my life. I now love to go to practice every day again and my social anxiety has completely dissolved. <br><br>“How can you do anything if you can’t even do nothing.” If you’re not good at doing nothing, how can you expect to be at your best doing something? Being able to reconnect with the present and your inner being at any moment boosts creativity, focus and productivity to a level you would never expect possible while dissolving fears, anxieties and worries. This is why meditation has become such a important part of my daily routine. <br><br>If you want to get into it, I recommend not using any guided meditation. For me, guided mediation is just another curtain over the present moment. So, I recommend simply sitting completely still in a comfortable chair and setting a timer for 30-minutes and observe all the thoughts that come into your mind. A very important aspect to realize is that there is no such thing as failing in meditation. By sitting still and listening to your thoughts, it is automatically successful. I think you find that the 30-minutes goes by much faster than you’d think. </p>

        <h2>Sunday Shorties: 1</h2>
        <h5>March 13, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">Sunday Shorties, every sunday I will post a fiction short story seeking to shed light on the why of my passions. Here's edition 1, would love to know what you think. It is my first time ever doing creative writing so don't be too harsh :). </h5>
        <p>“Gabe, you had a phenomenal season this year. You hit .402, with 8 home runs and 41 rbi’s leading the team in each while personifying what it looks like to be a selfless leader and having fun no matter if you had a good or bad game,” said Gabe’s coach at his little league teams end of the season celebration. <br><br>Gabe puts on a fake smile in the back yard of his coach’s house on a gorgeous August day surrounded by his teammates and all their parents after his team’s championship season as they enjoy barbeque from the teams sponsored restaurant. <br><br>Little did they all know that this would be Gabe’s last full season as he would quit it all together in the middle of the following one. Behind his fake smile, Gabe associated baseball with the constant torment from his father when he would strike out, make an error or virtually any other mistake. Gabe’s father was a former college baseball player that would’ve played professionally if not for his run ins with drugs and now his father was reliving his career and mistake’s he made through his son. <br><br>Gabe’s daily life looked something like this… <br></p>
        <ul>
          <li>8 am – 3 pm: School, in which the teachers would suck the life out of him by forcing him to complete mind-numbing activities.</li>
          <li>3 pm – 6 pm: Most days, Gabe and his friends would play video game’s which allowed him to be creative in the ways him and his friends competed to complete the game’s requirements.</li>
          <li>6 pm – Gabe’s bed time: When Gabe’s father got home from work and forced him to practice while constantly berating him on the different things he needed to work on.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Gabe’s father’s only intention was to help his son but he didn’t realize the emotional harm he was doing by reliving his past through his son. Little did he know Gabe would develop a hatred towards something that he used to be deeply in love with. <br><br>Imagine the future we are heading towards as the number of kids in Gabe’s situation increases. That sure isn’t one I’m going to let exist.</p>

        <h2>The movies behind wise eyes</h2>
        <h5>March 12, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">A bit of a longer and deeper post today.</h5>
        <p>My biggest fear is at the end of my life looking back with regret that I didn’t build what I dreamt of building or experience the things I dreamt of experiencing. Recently I had the opportunity to listen to someone speak about their time playing baseball at the same place I’m currently at and the look in his eyes left a permanent imprint in my brain. The amount of light he had in his eyes immediately reminded me of the look in my grandpa’s eyes after my grandmother died. I could never put my finger on why that look in his eyes was so powerful until I had the opportunity to listen to this man speak. Anatomically, the iris, the colored part of the eye, is a perforated muscular curtain. These perforations are like pixels that make up the movie screen as a portal into someone’s perspective and experience. If present enough to notice, the movie shown behind wise eyes can be an insanely valuable teacher. The powerful emotions combined with wisdom are what makes these movies viewable in ultra-high definition.<br><br>It was funny because he never mentioned a word about any actual games. Nothing about how well he played, nothing about what he had accomplished and nothing about how the team played or what they had accomplished. He talked about all the shenanigans he did with the people he cared about the most and the work him and his team struggled through to start building UNC Charlotte into what it has become today. At the time they didn’t even have a baseball field. They would go practice at a high school field and come back after and work tirelessly trying to make their own field. <br><br>Now thinking back to my time at JUCO when we were forced to make the most out of the little that we had, especially during COVID. When we got back in the late summer of 2020, our field was in shambles. It looked like it hadn’t been played on in decades. The six-foot-tall weeds spreading across the warning track was only the start, but as a team, we spent a week working our tails off pulling every single weed from the outfield and killing everything that was making the infield invisible. <br><br>It’s the things that are scratched and clawed for that really stick out in memories. I remember these periods of comfort in my life, like going on a relaxing vacation, long stretches of playing video games or going out and getting drunk to escape something and just exiting them feeling worse than I did before. On the flip side, the times of weeding the field at juco, river canoeing through the cold and rain on camping trips, staying up far too late working on my passions, strapping a portable mound to the top of my car and throwing plyos in my $200/month apartment are what have created true fulfilment in my life.<br><br>So, moral of the story, the more people that are building something, the better the world will be. My hope is for the future is for more people do the things and go the places that make them feel most alive.</p>

        <h2>Harnessing emtions</h2>
        <h5>March 11, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">Inspired by a conversation I had with a friend, a look into something I've been working to harness all of my life.</h5>
        <p>Being emotional can be a strength or a weakness depending on how it is harnessed, especially if it comes naturally.<br><br>A basketball coach I had when I was younger told me something that has stuck with me. After a game that we lost in which I fouled out in the third quarter and was a large part of my team losing, he told me “Don’t lose your ability to be emotional.”<br><br>Being emotional can be a detriment and remove from the present moment or it can pull even more deeply into the present.<br><br>Everyone has the power to choose which emotions they allow to drive them the most. Anger can drive a envious, ego driven spiral or it can be harnessed and boost curiosity creating even more momentum to your ultimate vision. In others words, use emotion to drive creativity, instead of despair.<br><br>Harness the energy of deep emotions, and let that energy build momentum in the adventure to excellence.</p>

        <h2>Deception</h2>
        <h5>March 10, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">My largest passion project is quantifying pitcher deception, said to be “One of baseball’s final unquantified frontiers.” </h5>
        <p>My largest passion project currently is quantifying pitcher deception, which is said to be “One of baseball’s final unquantified frontiers.”<br><br>I came across this quote recently, “All warfare is based on deception”. Spending so much time thinking about how a pitcher deceives a hitter has led me to ask broader questions about it.<br><br>These questions are mostly based off social media and how the algorithms can be made to deceive and coerce it’s users.<br><br>So naturally I ask, when is it okay to deceive someone else?<br><br>I think depends on the perspective and intentions, hitters hate hitting against deceptive pitchers but love playing behind them. I think much of the same is true in the broader sense.<br><br>Deceiving the other side in order to promote your own growth and success is a part of holding the competitive advantage, but the line of deceiving people on your side is much more fine.<br><br>How are you being deceived and by whom and what?</p>

        <h2>A beautiful aspect of pitching</h2>
        <h5>March 9, 2022</h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">Pitching is my first love. Here's part of what makes it unique that I've recently come to realize. </h5>
        <p>Pitchers all have relatively the same number of throws in their arms. This is my math brain speaking theoretically.<br><br>Unlike pretty much all other sports, pitchers are extremely limited in the amount they can physically practice their skill each day. Really, they can make over 100 throws twice a week at most to keep injury risk manageable and these other days they can only throw between 30 and 60 throws.<br><br>That all adds up to 500–750 throws per week depending on role at the highest throwing volume part of the year. A basketball player can shoot over 10,000 shots per week and a wide receiver can catch that many passes a week.<br><br>Theoretically the best pitchers are the one who are most efficient with their throws and practice the smartest. This is where science and pitching first collide and the crazy part is it is just on the surface of where they do.<br><br>It’s beautiful. Who can be most efficient?</p>
