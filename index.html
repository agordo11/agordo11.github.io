        <h2>Harnessing emtions</h2>
        <h5>March 11, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">Inspired by a conversation I had with a friend, a look into something I've been working to harness all of my life.</h5>
        <p>Emotionality can be a strength or a weakness depending on how you decide to harness the ability, especially if comes naturally.<br><br>A basketball coach I had when I was younger told me something that has stuck with me. After a game that we lost in which I fouled out in the third quarter and was a large part of my team losing, he told me “Don’t lose your ability to be emotional.”<br><br>Being emotional can be a detriment and remove from the present moment or it can pull you even more deeply into the present. It’s all about how you choose to respond.<br><br>Everyone has the power to choose which emotions they allow to drive them the most. For example, anger can send you into an envious, ego driven spiral or you can harness it and let it drive you with even more momentum to your ultimate vision. So maybe use the emotion to drive creativity and instead of despair and overthinking. <br><br>So, instead of letting an emotion like anger drive you down with dark energy, let that energy fuel the momentum in your adventure to excellence.<br><br>Embrace the emotions and learn to use them, just a part of the journey.</p>

        <h2>Deception</h2>
        <h5>March 10, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">My largest passion project is quantifying pitcher deception, said to be “One of baseball’s final unquantified frontiers.” </h5>
        <p>All warfare is based on deception.<br><br>Pitchers deceiving hitters. Presidents deceiving prime ministers and dictators and vice versa. The media deceiving everyone.<br><br>But is deception truly a negative thing, in which its’ connotation suggests?<br><br>My answer is it depends on your perspective and intentions, hitters hate hitting against deceptive pitchers but love playing behind. I think much of the same is true in the broader sense. <br><br>Deceiving the other side in order to promote your own growth and success is just a part of holding the competitive advantage. This brings up the question why deceive your own side. Under what circumstances is it okay to deceive your own team the people you fight with? <br><br>How are you being deceived and by whom and what?</p>

        <h2>Broad view of the beautiful natue of pitching</h2>
        
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">March 8, 2022 --- Pitching is my first love. Here's part of what makes it unique that I've recently come to realize. </h5>
        <p>Pitchers all have relatively the same number of throws in their arms. This is my math brain speaking in theocraticals.<br><br>Unlike pretty much all other sports, pitchers are extremely limited in the amount they can physically practice their skill each day. Really, they can make over 100 throws twice a week at most to keep injury risk manageable and these other days they can only throw between 30 and 60 throws. <br><br>That all adds up to 500-750 throws per week depending on role at the highest throwing volume part of the year. A basketball player can shoot over 10,000 shots per week and a wide receiver can catch that many passes a week.<br><br>Theoretically the best pitchers are the one who are most efficient with their throws and practice the smartest. This is where science and pitching first collide and the crazy part is it is just on the surface of where they do.<br><br>It’s beautiful. Who can be most efficient?</p>
