        <h2>Harnessing emtions</h2>
        <h5>March 11, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">Inspired by a conversation I had with a friend, a look into something I've been working to harness all of my life.</h5>
        <p>Being emotional can be a strength or a weakness depending on how it is harnessed, especially if it comes naturally.<br><br>A basketball coach I had when I was younger told me something that has stuck with me. After a game that we lost in which I fouled out in the third quarter and was a large part of my team losing, he told me “Don’t lose your ability to be emotional.”<br><br>Being emotional can be a detriment and remove from the present moment or it can pull even more deeply into the present.<br><br>Everyone has the power to choose which emotions they allow to drive them the most. For example, anger can drive a envious, ego driven spiral or it can be harnessed and drive a curiosity creating even more momentum to an ultimate vision. In others words, use emotion to drive creativity, instead of despair and overthinking.<br><br>Harness the energy of deep emotions, and let that energy fuel the momentum in the adventure to excellence.</p>

        <h2>Deception</h2>
        <h5>March 10, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">My largest passion project is quantifying pitcher deception, said to be “One of baseball’s final unquantified frontiers.” </h5>
        <p>My largest passion project currently is quantifying pitcher deception, which is said to be “One of baseball’s final unquantified frontiers.”<br><br>I came across this quote recently, “All warfare is based on deception”. Spending so much time thinking about how a pitcher deceives a hitter has led me to ask broader questions about it.<br><br>These questions are mostly based off social media and how the algorithms can be made to deceive and coerce it’s users.<br><br>So naturally I ask, when is it okay to deceive someone else?<br><br>I think depends on the perspective and intentions, hitters hate hitting against deceptive pitchers but love playing behind them. I think much of the same is true in the broader sense.<br><br>Deceiving the other side in order to promote your own growth and success is a part of holding the competitive advantage, but the line of deceiving people on your side is much more fine.<br><br>How are you being deceived and by whom and what?</p>

        <h2>Broad view of the beautiful natue of pitching</h2>
        <h5>March 9, 2022</h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">Pitching is my first love. Here's part of what makes it unique that I've recently come to realize. </h5>
        <p>Pitchers all have relatively the same number of throws in their arms. This is my math brain speaking theoretically.<br><br>Unlike pretty much all other sports, pitchers are extremely limited in the amount they can physically practice their skill each day. Really, they can make over 100 throws twice a week at most to keep injury risk manageable and these other days they can only throw between 30 and 60 throws.<br><br>That all adds up to 500–750 throws per week depending on role at the highest throwing volume part of the year. A basketball player can shoot over 10,000 shots per week and a wide receiver can catch that many passes a week.<br><br>Theoretically the best pitchers are the one who are most efficient with their throws and practice the smartest. This is where science and pitching first collide and the crazy part is it is just on the surface of where they do.<br><br>It’s beautiful. Who can be most efficient?</p>
