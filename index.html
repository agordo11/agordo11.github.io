        <h2>The movies behind wise eyes</h2>
        <h5>March 12, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">A bit of a longer and deeper post today.</h5>
        <p>My biggest fear is at the end of my life looking back with regret that I didn’t build what I dreamt of building or experience the things I dreamt of experiencing. Recently I had the opportunity to listen to someone speak about their time playing baseball at the same place I’m currently at and the look in his eyes left a permanent imprint in my brain. The amount of light he had in his eyes immediately reminded me of the look in my grandpa’s eyes after my grandmother died. I could never put my finger on why that look in his eyes was so powerful until I had the opportunity to listen to this man speak. Anatomically, the iris, the colored part of the eye, is a perforated muscular curtain. These perforations are like pixels that make up the movie screen as a portal into someone’s perspective and experience. If present enough to notice, the movie shown behind wise eyes can be an insanely valuable teacher. The powerful emotions combined with wisdom are what makes these movies viewable in ultra-high definition.<br><br>It was funny because he never mentioned a word about any actual games. Nothing about how well he played, nothing about what he had accomplished and nothing about how the team played or what they had accomplished. He talked about all the shenanigans he did with the people he cared about the most and the work him and his team struggled through to start building UNC Charlotte into what it has become today. At the time they didn’t even have a baseball field. They would go practice at a high school field and come back after and work tirelessly trying to make their own field. <br><br>Now thinking back to my time at JUCO when we were forced to make the most out of the little that we had, especially during COVID. When we got back in the late summer of 2020, our field was in shambles. It looked like it hadn’t been played on in decades. The six-foot-tall weeds spreading across the warning track was only the start, but as a team, we spent a week working our tails off pulling every single weed from the outfield and killing everything that was making the infield invisible. <br><br>It’s the things that are scratched and clawed for that really stick out in memories. I remember these periods of comfort in my life, like going on a relaxing vacation, long stretches of playing video games or going out and getting drunk to escape something and just exiting them feeling worse than I did before. On the flip side, the times of weeding the field at juco, river canoeing through the cold and rain on camping trips, staying up far too late working on my passions, strapping a portable mound to the top of my car and throwing plyos in my $200/month apartment are what have created true fulfilment in my life.<br><br>So, moral of the story, the more people that are building something, the better the world will be. My hope is for the future is for more people do the things and go the places that make them feel most alive.</p>

        <h2>Harnessing emtions</h2>
        <h5>March 11, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">Inspired by a conversation I had with a friend, a look into something I've been working to harness all of my life.</h5>
        <p>Being emotional can be a strength or a weakness depending on how it is harnessed, especially if it comes naturally.<br><br>A basketball coach I had when I was younger told me something that has stuck with me. After a game that we lost in which I fouled out in the third quarter and was a large part of my team losing, he told me “Don’t lose your ability to be emotional.”<br><br>Being emotional can be a detriment and remove from the present moment or it can pull even more deeply into the present.<br><br>Everyone has the power to choose which emotions they allow to drive them the most. Anger can drive a envious, ego driven spiral or it can be harnessed and boost curiosity creating even more momentum to your ultimate vision. In others words, use emotion to drive creativity, instead of despair.<br><br>Harness the energy of deep emotions, and let that energy build momentum in the adventure to excellence.</p>

        <h2>Deception</h2>
        <h5>March 10, 2022<br></h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">My largest passion project is quantifying pitcher deception, said to be “One of baseball’s final unquantified frontiers.” </h5>
        <p>My largest passion project currently is quantifying pitcher deception, which is said to be “One of baseball’s final unquantified frontiers.”<br><br>I came across this quote recently, “All warfare is based on deception”. Spending so much time thinking about how a pitcher deceives a hitter has led me to ask broader questions about it.<br><br>These questions are mostly based off social media and how the algorithms can be made to deceive and coerce it’s users.<br><br>So naturally I ask, when is it okay to deceive someone else?<br><br>I think depends on the perspective and intentions, hitters hate hitting against deceptive pitchers but love playing behind them. I think much of the same is true in the broader sense.<br><br>Deceiving the other side in order to promote your own growth and success is a part of holding the competitive advantage, but the line of deceiving people on your side is much more fine.<br><br>How are you being deceived and by whom and what?</p>

        <h2>A beautiful aspect of pitching</h2>
        <h5>March 9, 2022</h5>
        <h5 style="color: #B22222">Pitching is my first love. Here's part of what makes it unique that I've recently come to realize. </h5>
        <p>Pitchers all have relatively the same number of throws in their arms. This is my math brain speaking theoretically.<br><br>Unlike pretty much all other sports, pitchers are extremely limited in the amount they can physically practice their skill each day. Really, they can make over 100 throws twice a week at most to keep injury risk manageable and these other days they can only throw between 30 and 60 throws.<br><br>That all adds up to 500–750 throws per week depending on role at the highest throwing volume part of the year. A basketball player can shoot over 10,000 shots per week and a wide receiver can catch that many passes a week.<br><br>Theoretically the best pitchers are the one who are most efficient with their throws and practice the smartest. This is where science and pitching first collide and the crazy part is it is just on the surface of where they do.<br><br>It’s beautiful. Who can be most efficient?</p>
